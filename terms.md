**TLDR**: You must be a legal adult. We value free speech. You should be respectful in public. We are a community. Engage in respectful debate, not hateful rhetoric.

## A quick word
We understand that in certain contexts, breach of these terms cannot be avoided. For example, victims of abuse, whistle blowers, political asylum seekers, human rights organisations, and so on, may be in a position where breach of these terms is a necessity.

Therefore, Magaya reserves the right to void breaches of these terms in cases where it is deemed an absolute necessity or is otherwise unavoidable.

If you are in a position where this is the case, please don't hesitate to [get in touch](/contact/) and we will work with you to the best of our ability.

P.S.: Magaya remains neutral on all of the decisions we make. *Magaya will never* ***ever*** take sides for our own benefit or yours.
