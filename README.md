> *"A state of peace, freedom from hostilities, and true justice for all."*

An Australian based Matrix instance for you to communicate and collaborate with friends, family, and colleagues. All while maintaining your privacy and security. Magaya is both a Matrix instance and an educational service. Our goal is to connect the community, and to educate every person along the way.

Welcome to our public repository. This will house all of Magaya's guides for public review and community contributions. We think this is the best way to consistently improve.

The folder structure represents the same structure as used on [Magaya.org](https://magaya.org/docs/get-started/introduction/).

## Thank you

For any contributors, users, and sharers of our documentation, thank you very much.
