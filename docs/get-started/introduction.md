## Hello!

Welcome to Magaya! And thank you for stopping by. If you're new to Matrix and Element you should keep reading on through our brief guide to get you started.

The [Magaya Manual](/docs/get-started/quick-start/) has been written with beginners in mind. Our Manual will guide you through the entire process from choosing a Matrix client, registering an account, through to starting your own community.

To compliment the Manual, we have [The Spoken Glossary](/docs/get-started/spoken-glossary/) which is a simple but powerful document designed for understanding end-to-end encryption, decentralisation, Matrix, clients, privacy, security, and more. We encourage you to familiarise yourself with the technologies involved so you can make better decisions about your privacy and security in the digital world.

If you just want to get started, see our [quick start guide](/docs/get-started/a-real-quick-start/).

## Just quickly

> *Our goal is to connect the community securely and privately, and to educate every person along the way.*

We strongly believe in <a href="https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights/" target="_blank">our shared right to privacy</a> which is why Magaya.org provides a free-to-use Matrix instance for everyone to communicate on.

But we feel that it's just as important to be well informed about what you're doing when it comes to privacy, security, and encryption. So we spend a lot of time writing guides that *everyone* can understand.

The privacy of our lives is important. It's the same reason we have curtains on the windows of our homes. While it's easy to shut a door, or whisper quietely to keep a conversation private, it's not so easy to do the same with our digital lives.


## Knowledge is power
[The Spoken Glossary](/docs/get-started/spoken-glossary/) provides easy to understand definitions of technical terms such as [end-to-end encryption](/docs/get-started/spoken-glossary/#encryption), [homeservers](/docs/get-started/spoken-glossary/#matrix), or [cross signing](/docs/get-started/spoken-glossary/#cross-signing). From this you can establish a good understanding of what you're doing, so you can make better decisions in the digital world.

Easily digestible guides give you the power to understand what you're doing. Which means that you have much more control over your privacy and security. Please share these guides with those around you, as these are important topics that affect everybody!
